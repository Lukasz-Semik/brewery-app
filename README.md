# :wave: NOTE FROM DEV :D

During first call with recruitment, I was instructed to choose one from below tasks.
I think PWA and offline approach is the most interesting...

**SEE THIS PR IN ORDER TO VIEW MY CHANGES TO EXISTING CODE OR JUST SWITCH TO BRACNH `lukasz`**

Due to time constraints, I did just a short "example" for non production or finished product code.

What is handled?:

- service worker to keep app working even without internet (displaying whatever user fetched when internet was on)
- use indexed db to store data from user

I have focused on home screen only.

Thanks, ≈Åukasz
